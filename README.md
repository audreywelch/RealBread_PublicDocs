“Real bread” means it’s made the way people have been making bread for centuries: in small batches, with a natural, wild yeast and ingredients that aren’t genetically modified, refined or bleached. This bread gives your body nourishment, is easy to digest and tastes absolutely delicious!

The Real Bread app shows bakeries and restaurants around the world that are making and selling sourdough bread. Users will find a description of the bakery, pictures of their products, open hours, as well as location and contact information. Each bakery is also tagged by characteristics including whether or not they also serve food, are using organic ingredients, or mill their own grains.

Users can also submit bakeries they know of that are making real bread that may not be on the app, yet (we crust you - it's the yeast we can do).

So whether you're a fermentation enthusiast, or on the search for bread that can fit into a restrictive diet, the Real Bread app can help you be sure about where to find that "real bread." Free the glutens!
